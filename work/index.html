                            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read,
                                easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to 
                                load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                            <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly and accurately convert it into a webpage that is a pixel-perfect match.</p>
