                    <h2>Hi, I'm Debbie. I'm a front-end developer and web designer.</h2>
                        <div class="half-width">
                            <p>I began my career as a graphic designer and art director in the advertising industry and continued adding skills - and titles - throughout the years that included
                                Creative Director, Marketing Director, Food Stylist and now, Front-end Developer.</p>

                            <p>I had been in restaurant marketing for many years and discovered I was happiest working with our web developers and designers. That fascinated me. Then one day
                                I realized that would be my next career. And I have loved it ever since.
